# SCUMM-Decompilation-Archive
A collection of decompiled source code for Lucasfilm and Humongous Entertainments's SCUMM games.

Previously, this code was created by extracting the data files using tools like scummrp and scummpacker. Then each individual script was decompiled by using descumm (included in ScummVM's tools). Finally, I neatly organized them into .c files (for the purpose of preview highlighting)

Now, I use NUTcracker to decompile the scripts. It currently supports v5-v8, including the Humongous Entertainment games. Hopefully, earlier versions will follow.

I have no idea how or if this can be recompiled, but I did get the inspiration from a similar disassembly project for the C64 version of Maniac Mansion.
